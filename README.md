### Description

This is the ultimate weather program, Weather Of the World will give the weather of all cities in ever countries, Hurricane Tracking, Flying to and from other Countries, their G.P.S. location, facts & statics about that country, time & date, Airport Arrival listing all major airports of a country, Airline information of every airline of all countries, Air quality & UV control report, international calling code for all countries and many more new feature . I have remove the LVbuttons.ocx from program so there will be no need for ocx registration.
